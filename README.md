## 23 Short Questions
1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?
	The problem we are addressing is for people who want quick loans in a competitive markertplace where loans sharks compete against each other for the lowest interest rate to offer the loan requester.
2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?
The problem is that users can't get decent interest rates on there loans sometimes due to going to a single place for a loan. This solves that issue as they can get multiple loan offers and review them.
3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.
The way the project works is there will be two user accounts, loan requesters and loan offereres. The loan requester puts up a "listing" of the amouunt they require, a financer will then offer there rates on the page against the other offerers. The requester then selects their favourite offer, pays the interest as a down payment then recieves the money.
4. Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
It will be deployed on heroku and created on ruby on rails. /NEED TO CHECK
5. /REVIST THIS AT END Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.
We are using ruby on rails with the devise gem to authenticate users, the cancancan gem for authorization. Stripe for the down payments on the interest. Faker to help seed the data as well. Bootstrap for the design. /REVIST THIS AT END
